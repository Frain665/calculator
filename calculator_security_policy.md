# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions of Modern Calculator:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🔍 Security Considerations

Modern Calculator is a desktop application built with C++ and wxWidgets. While it's primarily a computational tool, we take security seriously to ensure user safety and data integrity.

### Current Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All mathematical expressions are validated to prevent buffer overflows
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling prevents application crashes from malformed input
- **Memory Safety**: Proper memory management using RAII principles and smart pointers
- **Division by Zero Protection**: Built-in safeguards against division by zero operations

### Potential Security Areas

As a desktop calculator application, the main security considerations include:

- **Input Parsing**: Mathematical expression evaluation and number parsing
- **Memory Management**: Proper handling of string operations and UI components
- **File Operations**: Future features may include save/load functionality
- **Network Communications**: Not currently applicable, but relevant for future cloud features

## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Users

### Safe Usage Guidelines

1. **Download from Official Sources**
   - Always download from official GitHub releases
   - Verify checksums when provided
   - Avoid third-party distributions

2. **Keep Software Updated**
   - Install security updates promptly
   - Subscribe to release notifications

3. **System Security**
   - Run with standard user privileges (not administrator)
   - Use updated antivirus software
   - Keep your operating system updated

### For Developers

1. **Secure Development**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Use static analysis tools
   - Perform code reviews for security

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep wxWidgets updated to latest stable version
   - Monitor security advisories for dependencies
   - Use dependency scanning tools

3. **Testing**
   - Include security testing in development process
   - Test with various input edge cases
   - Use memory analysis tools (Valgrind, AddressSanitizer)

## 🔍 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Input Validation**
   - Large number inputs may cause display issues
   - Very long decimal numbers are truncated

2. **Memory Usage**
   - No built-in limits on calculation history (future feature)
   - String operations could potentially consume excess memory

### Planned Security Improvements

- [ ] Enhanced input validation for edge cases
- [ ] Memory usage limits and monitoring
- [ ] Automated security testing in CI/CD
- [ ] Static code analysis integration
- [ ] Fuzzing tests for input parsing
